\chapter*{Abstract}

Distribution of matter (both dark-matter and baryonic) in the large scale structures
of the Universe provides wealth of information about its contents and evolution
with cosmic time. However, distribution of matter in dense systems like inner regions
of galaxy clusters or groups provides information about the nature of dark-matter,
baryonic processes and merging history of the system.
