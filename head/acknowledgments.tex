\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express deepest gratitude to my committee chair,
Dr. Prasenjit Saha, who has the attitude and substance of a genius.
He continously and convincingly conveyed a spirit of adventure
with regard to research, and an excitement in teaching. 
Without his guidance and persistent help, this dissertation 
would not have been possible. 

I would like to thank my joint advisors, Professor Uro\v s Seljak and
Professor Romain Teyssier, whose work demonstrated to me the 
excellence of scientific research, and a need of critical thinking
about the future of cosmology and astrophysics.

I would like to thank Janu Verma, a very dear friend, for reading 
the manuscript, and providing necessary stylistic improvements. 
I would also like to thank Christian Reinhardt for carefully
reading the dissertation, and making useful comments.

In addition, I would like to thank fellow students and post-doctoral
associates in the institute for fruitful conversations about
science, and life in general. I would like to thank everyone
in the {\it Physik Institute} and the {\it Institute for Computational Science}
for establishing an ideal environment to carry out scientific research.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family and
friends for keeping things easy around me, so I could 
keep working without difficult moments.
