\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express deepest appreciation to my committee chair,
Dr. Prasenjit Saha who has the attitude and substance of a genius: 
he continously and convincingly conveyed a spirit of adventure
in regard to research, and an excitement in regard to teaching. 
Without his guidance and persistent help this dissertation 
would not have been possible. 

I would like to thank my joint advisors, Professor Uros Seljak and
Professor Romain Teyssier, whose work demonstrated to me the 
excellence of scientific research and need of critical thinking
about the future of cosmology and astrophysics.

I would like to thank Janu Verma, a very dear friend, to read 
the manuscript, and provide necessary stylistic improvements. 
I would also like to thank Christian Reinhardt to carefully
read the dissertation and provide useful comments.

In addition, I would like to thank fellow students and post-doctoral
associates in the institute for fruitful conversations about
science, and life in general. I would like to thank everyone
in the {\it Physik Institut} and {\it Institute for Computational Science}
to make an ideal environment to carry out scientific research.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my friends and
family for keeping things easy around me, so I could 
keep working without difficult moments.
