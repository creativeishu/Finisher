\chapter{Paper3: Baryonic effects on weak-lensing two-point statistics}\label{paper:baryoniceffects}

According to the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF; \cite{2006astro.ph..9591A}), 
the two-point statistics of the weak gravitational lensing is amongst the most promising
tools to do cosmology and derive strong constraints on the cosmological parameters. 
However, it is dominated by many systematics, both observational and theoretical.
In this paper, we focussed on an extremely important source of systematic errors in the 
theory of weak lensing shear power spectrum - {\it baryonic effects}. 

The theoretical modelling of the weak-lensing shear power spectrum
is described in section \ref{sec:wl} for a dark-matter only Universe, 
which is a fair approximation
at large scales, which was the limit to the weak-lensing experiments in the past. 
The next generation surveys like Euclid, LSST etc, 
are pushing this limit far into the small scales such
that baryonic contribution becomes important. In this paper, we built a model
to incorporate baryonic contribution in the matter power spectrum,
and by extension to the weak lensing shear power spectrum. Our model is based on 
the halo model where the baryonic contribution is sensitive to mainly two quantities: 
the halo mass function, and the radial density profiles of the halos.

Our baryonic model consists of four main ingredients: 
(i) hot intra cluster gas assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium;
(ii) a stellar component dominated by a central galaxy 
whose mass is constrained by the abundance matching techniques;
(iii) a feedback model that removes the gas from the halo as a function
of its mass; and 
(iv) an adiabatically contracted dark-matter component. 
Incorporating these four components, 
we can reproduce hydrodynamical simulations 
for the radial profile of the halos, and the matter power spectrum. 

We performed a cosmological parameter forecast for a Euclid like survey and found that using
weak-lensing alone, Euclid is expected to constrain the cosmological parameters to a very
high accuracy. However, if the baryonic effects are not taken into account, it will bias
the recovered values of the parameters and mislead the interpretations. On the other hand,
if the baryonic effects are taken into account, all cosmological
parameters can still be constrained with good accuracy along with the parameters
of the baryonic model.

{\bf Role:} Under the supervision of Professor Romain Teyssier, I started
this project by developing a code to compute the matter power spectrum
in the halo model framework, assuming dark-matter only (DMO) Universe. 
I used the Navarro Frenk White (NFW) radial density profiles for the 
dark-matter halos, and the mass-function from 
Tinker et al. 2008. The next step was to include the baryonic
physics in the framework. 
I did this in three steps: (i) I included two baryonic components
to the radial density profile; intra-cluster plasma, 
and a bright central galaxy (BCG), (ii) I changed 
the gas mass fraction from being a constant to be dependent on the mass
of the halo regulated by a free parameter $M_{\rm crit}$, (iii)
I included the adiabatic contraction of the dark-matter component
due to the BCG. This comprise the full baryonic
model. I compare the radial density profiles of this model
to the simulations provided by Davide Martizzi ,and found 
a remarkable agreement. 
Incorporating this prescription in the halo model framework, I computed
the modified matter power spectrum with baryons, and studied its
deviation from the DMO case for variable 
$M_{\rm crit}$ parameters.  
I wrote an extension of this code to compute the weak-lensing
shear power spectrum for given a matter power spectrum. I studied
the similar effects of baryons on weak lensing power spectrum
for variable $M_{\rm crit}$ parameters. I studied the weak lensing
observable in three redshifts bins, and performed a tomographic 
analysis of the weak lensing shear power spectrum for a Euclid like
survey. Using this code, I made a mock dataset with baryons, and included
random noise in the observables.
I ran two sets of 8 MCMC, each for a different $\ell_{\rm max}$.
In the first
set the model was dark-matter only, and in the second case, it was
with the bayonic physics. 
To ensure convergence, each MCMC analysis was based on  
16 individual chains.
